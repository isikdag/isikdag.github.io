Research Paths
======

I started coding at the age of nine as a hobby in :85, which then become my life-style since then.My first PC was [Amstrad CPC 6128](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amstrad_CPC) 
which forced me learning BASIC from [this book](https://www.cpcwiki.eu/imgs/e/ea/Amstradcpc6128manual.pdf) to use it.Also I learned 
little bit of [COBOL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL), a few bits of [PASCAL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language)) at that time :85-88.
Following a long break between :88-95, in the university I learned to program in 
[Fortran77](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19957-01/802-2998/802-2998.pdf) to help me in engineering calculations, and also used 
[Autocad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AutoCAD_version_history) versions R10 (no windows), R12 (windows) for technical
drawing in :94-96.I was online for the first time in :97.In final two years of  my degree :96-98, I learned to code in [Classic Visual Basic](), [HTML](), [VBScpirt](), [MathCAD]().
Later, I learned [ASP](), [SQL](), [Perl/CGI](), [Javascript]() in :98-99 period. I then learned [C](), [C++](), [PHP]() between :99-01, [Java](), [JSP](), [VB.Net](), [C#](), [ISO3030 Express]() between :01-04
I then learned [R](), [Python](), [MATLAB]() between :15-18. Today,[ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) knows all these languages much better than me :) I want my years back!. My love in coding has formed my academic career, which has taken me to different research paths since :98
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

Artificial Intelligence
------
My MSc was on the development of an [Expert System (AI) for Bridge Design](files/msc_thesis.pdf) :98-99, I remember days I was trying to learn [CLIPS](https://www.clipsrules.net) in my Msc.
Those were the times when people were also trying to develop AI tools using [Prolog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog), but I ended up developing my tool as an MS Excel VBA 
based [software](files/msc_code.xls).Please [unblock macros](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-en/microsoft-365-apps/security/internet-macros-blocked) to try it. 
I started self-learning Statistics in 2012, and working on coding AI in 2015, with [Bayesian Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_network)
 and [Markov Chains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain).I still have not published anything on either of these topics :(( , and then started learning simple Machine Learning algorithms.
Today this path is the one that keeps me most busy, where I focus on ML,ANNs,DL,Transformers,GPTs and other Generative Learning Models, especially on 
Neural Architecture Search,Language and Vision Models .

BIM and GIS Integration
------
 My PhD research :02-07 was on [BIM GIS Integration](https://salford-repository.worktribe.com/output/1434038/towards-the-implementation-of-building-information-models-in-geospatial-context)
, where I developed a [software](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjWRQUTDgLAPZ0EGWbw3UMj27GU4nMYFZ) for transferring IFC objects from an ISO10303 [database](https://jotneconnect.com/products/express-data-manager/)
 and persisting into a 3D GeoDatabase as [multipatch](https://www.esri.com/content/dam/esrisites/sitecore-archive/Files/Pdfs/library/whitepapers/pdfs/multipatch-geometry-type.pdf) features.
Three key outputs were a [summary](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1474034608000499) of my PhD, an intro to the [indoor model](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0198971513000434)
which I developed, and a discussion on how the BIM-GIS integration benefits in case of a [fire response](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17452007.2007.9684636) scenario.
Two of these outputs have now become my [mostly cited](https://scholar.google.com.tr/citations?hl=tr&authuser=1&user=weQbA-EAAAAJ) academic papers.

BIM and IoT and GIS Integration for Smart Cities
------
During my PhD I worked as a Senior Researcher at Coventry University with [Nigel Trodd](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nigeltrodd) in :04 on Smart Cities with [IntelCities](https://www.itas.kit.edu/english/projects_pask04_intelcity.php)
project, where I learned about distributed computing and service oriented approaches for integration, and  coded in frameworks such as 
[COM+](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_Object_Model) and [CORBA](https://www.corba.org/), 
which later helped me to code in [SOAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP) and [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST) styles. 
This has encouraged me to work on implementation of [SOA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture) and 
[Design Patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern) and [IoT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things) 
for/within BIM based information sharing. Key outputs of this path can be found in this [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0926580509001769)
and this [one](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0926580512000696), and also this [paper](https://dergipark.org.tr/en/pub/ijeg/issue/48877/587023) 
which looks at the exact same issue but from the GeoInformaiton Management perspective.Path from SOA to IoT is summarized with many Design Patterns in my [BIM and IoT Integration Patterns](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-21825-0) book.

BIM Intergration and Implementation
------ 
After I graduate from my PhD, I and my supervisor [Jason Underwood](https://www.salford.ac.uk/our-staff/jason-underwood), worked on publishing the 1st edited/multi-author 
[Handbook of Research on BIM ](https://www.igi-global.com/book/handbook-research-building-information-modeling/37234) in our field.In :13 I worked at University of Central Lancashire with [Jack Goulding](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jack-goulding-a0412614), 
on [BIM 2.0](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/14714171111148990/full/html).

Construction Informatics
------
My PhD journey started by looking at IT Strategy for Turkish Construction Industry :01-02, which resulted with my first [journal paper](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/09699980410547595/full/html)
 and my unpublished [Turkish Construction IT Vision](https://zenodo.org/records/1331943) book.Following this, our joint efforts together with 
 [Turkish Association of Informatics](https://www.tbd.org.tr/) have resulted in an 
academic conference series namely [Informatics for Structures and Cities](https://www.tbd.org.tr/yapi-ve-kennte-bilisim-iv-bildiriler-kitabi-tbd-tbb-tmbd/) which has been organized 4 times, till 2006.
Later I started Construction Informatics [workshop](https://insaatbilisim.weebly.com/) in Turkish Academic Informatics [conference](https://www.ab.org.tr/) which ran for 10 consecutive years(:07-16), the 
event was highly supported by well-known Turkish ICT Prof. late [Mustafa Akgül](https://tr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustafa_Akg%C3%BCl) who also holds a Civil Engineering degree.

Construction Econometrics
------
Since :20 I have a great interest in time series modeling for construction.I have taken econometrics lectures from [Aycan Hepsağ](https://avesis.istanbul.edu.tr/hepsag) and 
some video lectures from other experts and read books to learn how to look at the time series problems that I deal with ANN, LSTM and Transformers with a different glass.
Unfortunately I have few outputs on this path.

Surveys,Exploratory Factor Analysis,Structural Equation Modeling
------
Since :18, I love learning Exploratory Factor Analysis,Confirmatory Factor Analysis, Structural Equation Modeling (Covariance and PLS based).I have taken several video courses and read some books in the field.
Unfortunately I have very few and basic outputs on this path.

Construction Management
------
I have got my Associate Professorship degree in this field. As both my MSc and PhD was on Construction Informatics, it has been very difficult for me to pass the exam and get the degree.In fact, the exam process 
which was repeated 3 times and spanned over 2+ years, have contributed a lot to my personal development in this field.

Notable Events
======

First Rejection
------
I think not only getting getting rejected from a peer-reviewed journal in my attempt to publish my 2nd journal paper, but getting rejected this way was very notable in my academic life.
During my PhD I was at the stage of developing my software.I think year was :04, based on all positive feedback from the conferences have motivated me to submit my early
findings to a peer-reviewed journal.I got my first rejection after 3 months, with one line of message from the editor. I was very upset and got back to the editor, and
asked about whare the work was weak or insufficient. I got a reply with one word this time : Attached ! . When I check the attachement I noticed that one of the reviewers
was not only finding my work insufficient, but was very angry to editor, for sending him/her my paper and taking his/her time to read my work.When I read this Attachment,
the first thing I can think of was quitting my PhD, quitting academia and looking for a new job. My supervisors thankfully encouraged me to keep calm and carry on at that time.
but I did not have a courage to write and send another paper to a journal for 3-4 more years to come till early :08.What a rejection !.

Edited Books  
------
As I tried to mention above [Handbook of Research on BIM ](https://www.igi-global.com/book/handbook-research-building-information-modeling/37234) was my first experience in editing an academic book.
The interest and excitement to write a chapter for this book was unbelievable.To deserve the value that the collagues have given to this work, I spent nearly a year :09 doing nothing but editing this book.The book is very thick as is around 800 pages.Some of my students next door
used the book as a portable coffe table :) in the times they were not reading it.I believe it is really worth to read this book to understand the history and roots of BIM, and difficulties faced in the first 10 years of transformation.
The book is dedicated to our friend late [Jeff Wix]() who was one of the developers of IFC model.The book has a very similar name with the other (and to be honest more well-known)
[BIM Handbook](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9781119287568) of late [Charles Eastman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_M._Eastman) et al., 
but during our proposal their book was not published, in addition, the name choice was compulsory, due to the naming of the IGI Global Handbook of Research series 
that we have published in.I did not have a chance to meet with Prof.Eastman face to face,I wish I had a signed copy of his book from him,it is really a pity :( .
